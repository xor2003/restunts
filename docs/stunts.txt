*  [1.2] A WORD ABOUT THE CREATORS

     Stunts/4D Sports Driving was developed by Distinctive Software Inc. (DSI)
     in  1990.  DSI  was founded by Don  Mattrick  and Jeff Sember in 1982. At
     least  from  1988 until 1991 DSI  resided  in Vancouver, British Columbia
     (Canada). Electronic Arts took over DSI in 1991.

     First  versions of Stunts/4D Sports  Driving were published by Bríderbund
     Software as Stunts in October 1990. Later ones were brought to the gamers
     by Mindscape (a Software Toolworks company) as 4D Sports Driving.

   [1.3] AN INTERVIEW WITH DON MATTRICK

     (by Lynne Henderson for the Canadian "The Computer Paper", 1990)

     THE GAMES GAME

     Don  Mattrick is in The Games Game. As co-founder of Distinctive Software
     Inc.,  26-year-old  Mattrick has come a  long  way from his Burnaby North
     high  school days and his first  business success with the computer game,
     Evolution.   Now,  as  the  chairman  of  B.C.'s  largest  computer  game
     development  company, he presently devotes 60 to 70 hours a week to games
     and  entertainment  software,  his  growing  business  that  yielded $3.2
     million revenue in 1989.

     NAUTICAL BUT NICE

     His  4th-storey  view  office,  decorated with  a  large  Metal  Art fish
     sculpture   and  a  spectacular  wall-to-wall   tropical  fish  tank,  is
     reminiscent of a captain's quarters in a luxury yacht. It is a Nemo-esque
     haven  apart from the madcap offices of  his R and D group where creative
     license  is  apparent with high-tech  toys, MIDI equipment, arcade games,
     and  graffiti  on the "playroom" walls.  Mattrick  speaks modestly of his
     successes  which have in January 1990 allowed him to take over the entire
     14,000-square-foot  fourth  floor of his building  - one step toward even
     greater  future  expansion. "We've had a  lot of successful ventures as a
     company.  I think some of the most important accomplishments that we have
     are  the client base that we work  with at this time; companies like Walt
     Disney,  Konami,  Electronic  Arts,  Accolade,  Bríderbund,  NEC,  IBM  -
     companies  that publish products throughout the  world and are in the top
     ten  in  our industry." Mattrick co-founded  DSI  in 1982 with a partner,
     Jeff  Sember. The two severed their relationship three and one half years
     ago.  The company has grown steadily in  the past few years and employees
     number  close to 80 at this time. The average age is only 27. Mattrick is
     proud   of   his   unique  team.  The   creation   of  software  is  very
     time-intensive, he explains, and projects take many man-years to complete
     and  require specialized skills, teamwork,  patience and dedication to be
     successful.  "We  have  a diverse group  of  people that have specialized
     skills  and  bring  a spark to the artistic  side  of  what it is we do."
     Mattrick  emphasizes  the importance of a  good team and notes that every
     year  that  they are together they  improve  their performance as well as
     their  products. Part of the success of  the firm is linked to his strong
     family   ties.   His  mother,  Joan   Mattrick,  is  active  as  manager,
     administration   services,   while   his   cousin   Bruce   McMillan   is
     vice-president  of  operations. Mattrick recognizes  that  his success is
     determined  both  by  how well the products  sell  and are enjoyed by the
     buying  public,  and  peer  acceptance.  For  example,  the  emergence of
     Nintendo  has had a dramatic impact on the consumer market. An authorized
     Nintendo  developer, DSI develops products for the Nintendo Entertainment
     System  8-bit  system, and Gameboy handheld  and new 16-bit Super Famicon
     System  in  the future. He announces  that  in the upcoming quarter, some
     major  Nintendo  titles  will  be released,  with  TV,  print and special
     promotions.  As  well, Bill Elliot's  NASCAR  Challenge (Konami), Teenage
     Mutant  Ninja Turtles (Konami) and  4D Sports Boxing (Software Toolworks)
     are scheduled for release.

     HIGHER AND DEEPER

     Aside  from  the emergence of the  dedicated video game machine, Mattrick
     addresses  the  fact  that  all products  tend  to  increase  in scope as
     consumers  become more sophisticated. "So  product quality need be higher
     and  the  designs need be deeper in terms  of game play and the amount of
     hours  that  it takes to complete  a product." He recognises that company
     growth  must  be balanced by maintaining a  cash reserve in the advent of
     their  market  declining or the economy  cooling in North America. Market
     share   which  is  dependent  upon   time,  product  and  competition  is
     unpredictable in many ways.

     DRIVING FORCE

     Mattrick  is proud of his driving products, which have been a focal point
     for Distinctive Software. They've produced the now-famous Accolade titles
     Test  Drive,  Grand Prix Circuit and The  Duel  - Test Drive II including
     various  car  and scenery disks for  those products. Hardball II and Test
     Drive II continue to sell well and maintain their position within the top
     twenty  best sellers in North America. Some ten new driving products will
     be  released  between November 1 and the  first quarter of 1991. One from
     Bríderbund  called  Stunts  was  just released  within  the  last week. A
     Ferrari  owner, as well as an aficionado and racer of exotic automobiles,
     Mattrick's  eyes gleam with intensity as he explains, "It's a combination
     of  a  bitmap  and  3-D polygon-type  driving  game  where you can select
     various  cars, various opponents and build  your own race tracks to drive
     on.  The  race tracks can be normal  tracks  or tracks with stunts like a
     loop-de-loop  or  a corkscrew or jumps and it  tends to make for a lot of
     excitement." However, he is quick to specify that DSI is more than just a
     games developer. It has diversified into the educational software market.
     Mickey's  ABCs  and Mickey's 123s, which were  developed on the IBM PC as
     the  lead format, are two products  recently released with Disney for the
     Christmas season. He explains, "(It) comes with some specialized hardware
     that  allows  your  IBM  to have  digitized  speech  coming  back. So our
     software  is bundled with a hardware package and all that is coupled with
     a  fairly extensive advertising campaign with Disney targeted at families
     and  learning." Three or four years ago DSI worked with the government in
     the  area  of computer-aided  instruction programs. Mattrick acknowledges
     that  it was a different type of process as opposed to working with movie
     companies and private industry. Although rewarding in its own way, it was
     more  time-consuming. With the popularity his  company now enjoys, it can
     pick  and choose from virtually any  number of opportunities. "We've been
     in discussions with companies like Philips and various movie companies on
     new  development of intellectual property  [based on] movies and consumer
     goods,  on a frequent basis. The structure of the deals that we can do is
     anything from just a purely contractual relationship to shared investment
     and  risk."  Mattrick emphatically denies any  plans to go public at this
     time.  He states that DSI has been able  to grow and develop its own cash
     reserves without having to raise money from venture capitalists. Whatever
     the strategies are, revenues exceed $5M so far this year.

     FUTURE DIRECTIONS

     DSI  has  undergone a significant management  shift in the last year with
     the  appointment  of  Tarrnie  Williams  as  president.  Why did Mattrick
     appoint to the Number One Office the former CEO of Sydney Developments, a
     man  who  had received such notoriety  both  during and subsequent to his
     resignation  in  1984? Mattrick explains  that Williams had been involved
     with  DSI  over  the years in an  advisory  position at a board level. "I
     particularly  wanted someone who had a wide range of experience who could
     bring  different  ideas from past  experience and also understood people.
     And  I think with all the experience that Tarrnie's had, that's a minimum
     description  of  his  skill set." Mattrick  is  enthused about the future
     directions  his  company could take. "The  emergence of optical disks, CD
     ROM, CDI, DVI and CDTV all lend themselves to a number of exciting future
     prospects.  Outside  of  that  you  even  have  the  development  of  new
     technologies like virtual reality."

     ALL WORK AND NO PLAY?

     Although  he  approaches  work  responsibilities  with  a  high degree of
     intensity, Mattrick denies the adage that all work and no play make him a
     dull  guy. Equally important are friends, sports, car racing, and travel.
     For  December, he plans to combine Spanish beaches with his European work
     schedule,  which includes visits with  Mindscape, Software Toolworks, and
     some  friends  at  companies such as  US  Gold and Infogrames. When asked
     about  rumors  of his retiring at  age 30, this computer veteran jokingly
     replies,  "I've  booked my flight!" He looks  forward  to a time when his
     business could function without him. "That still leaves me four years and
     probably a lot of hard work and long evenings between now and that future
     point."

   [1.4] ELECTRONIC ARTS BUYS DISTINCTIVE SOFTWARE INC.

     (from the Canadian "The Computer Paper", 1991)

     Distinctive  Software  Inc.,  producer  of  popular  games  including the
     best-selling  Test  Drive  series,  has  been  sold  to  California-based
     Electronic  Arts for a reported $11 million. Under the terms of the sale,
     EA  will pay $785,000 in cash, with  the balance in shares. Don Mattrick,
     who co-founded DSI in 1982 with then-partner Jeff Sember (now at MindSpan
     Technologies),  will  continue as V.P.,  Marketing,  and Tarrnie Williams
     will stay on as DSI President.

   [1.5] A LATE REVIEW

     (by David Leadbetter for the "Game Bytes Magazine", 1994)

     INTRODUCTION

     If  you've  never  heard of the game  Stunts  by Bríderbund, or 4D Sports
     Driving  by  Mindscape (from here on  referenced  as Stunts), then please
     allow  me  to introduce you to this little  gem  of a game from days gone
     past.

     In  brief,  Stunts is a stunt car racing  game that has plenty of cars to
     drive,  plenty  of opponents to race  (and beat), plenty of cliff hanging
     stunts  to try, and thousands of hours of game playing excitement. Stunts
     is not a realistic racing simulator. If you want racing realism there are
     hordes of other titles out there to choose from.

     Stunts  belongs  to a distinct genre  of  games that include other titles
     such  as  Stunt Driver and Hard Drivin'  II. All promise to offer similar
     features, but Stunts inevitably rates the best due simply to it's perfect
     controllability, which is sadly lacking in the other titles no matter how
     much configurability the try to provide. (And in my opinion a racing game
     is not worth playing if the car is impossible to control!)

     GRAPHICS AND SOUND

     Visually,  Stunts  can  easily compare to  other  games  of it's time. It
     caters  for  a wide range of  machines, with video support for everything
     from  Hercules  graphics to VGA. This is  nice  to know if you don't have
     VGA, but I would not recommend playing with less. The game world is drawn
     with  3D  polygon graphics and includes  a selectable detail level, which
     provides  a fluid frame rate on even a  low end 386. A variety of horizon
     backdrops  and scenery add to the  overall atmosphere of the game (though
     you  don't normally have time to comment on such things while you thunder
     down  the  track  ;-)). Each car has  it's  own  rough polygon model, and
     dashboard design (which you see when you view from inside the car).

     Sound  support  is  equally  well  done.  Stunts  has  sound  support for
     everything  from  the PC speaker to  the  SoundBlaster. Stunts manages to
     provide  quite realistic engine and skidding sounds. A different sound is
     provided  for  each  car  you can  drive.  For  total enjoyment though, a
     SoundBlaster  is recommended (preferably pumped through an amplifier, for
     an engine you can feel ;-)).

     INTERFACE

     Stunts provides excellent game controls. It supports all three main input
     devices: keyboard, joystick and mouse. I recommend using the keyboard for
     easiest  driving control. Strangely enough it  is in this department that
     so  many other driving games fail. The most frequent problem I've seen is
     "super  sensitive/unresponsive steering". But Stunts handles exquisitely.
     The  designers  appear to have found  the perfect balance between initial
     turning  resistance for fine steering adjustments, and continuous turning
     speed for main maneuvering.

     THE RACING

     Before you begin racing, there are a few things you need to do.

     First,  select your car. Stunts has a wide range to choose from, from the
     slow  offroad 4WDs to turbo charged Formula  1 racing cars. Each car type
     has  it's advantages and disadvantages. The  4WDs are slow as snails, but
     handle well on icy roads. The racing cars on the other hand are fast, but
     are  not  much fun to drive on icy  roads  (in fact, it's possible to out
     drag  a F1 car in a 4WD on an  icy road over a short distance!). You also
     have the option of driving a manual or automatic gearbox for each car.

     Next,  you should pick your opponent. In  this area, Stunts has two modes
     of  racing.  A  "practice"  mode where  you  race  against  the clock (no
     opponent),  and  a  "competitive" mode where  you  race  against a single
     opponent. There are range of opponents all with their own various driving
     strengths.  Sadly,  the opponent intelligence  is rather weak in general.
     The  toughest opponent is called "Skid Vicious"  - a name to instill fear
     in  would be challengers perhaps? His  driving sure doesn't! In fact, all
     computer  opponents share a high level  of driving incompetence. They are
     slow,  will  reliably  crash on any  slightly  tricky  track, and if they
     don't,  it is unbearably easy to "influence" them into doing so. But, the
     computer  opponents can still provide a tough challenge if you don't mind
     racing them in a much slower car.

     Finally,  you  need  to pick a track  to  race. Stunts comes with a small
     number  of  rather  simple "training"  tracks,  and  those quickly become
     boring, but, Stunts comes with a fully featured built-in track editor, so
     you  can  make your own tracks to race.  It  is the presence of the track
     editor  and  it's  operating simplicity that  make  Stunts a really great
     game.

     You  can build tracks with three types of road surfaces, from solid paved
     roads  to  slippery  icy roads. There  are  a  variety of "standard" road
     pieces,  like  corners, chicanes, crossroads,  ramps, elevated roads, and
     banks. But the exciting part is the huge number of stunts pieces that you
     can   include  in  your  tracks.   The  range  includes  tunnels,  loops,
     corkscrews, piper, half pipes, "slalom" roads (roads with barricades that
     you have to "slalom" through), and corkscrew ramps. In addition there are
     a number of scenery pieces including buildings of various sizes, trees of
     various  types,  ships, and even a tennis  court! All these pieces can of
     course be combined together to make a vast variety of jumps and stunts.

     And, if you ever tire of the set of provided landscapes for building your
     tracks  on,  Stunts also includes a terrain  editor as part of it's track
     editor.

     Hint: The  terrain  editor is an undocumented  feature of Stunts. You can
           access   the  terrain  pieces  in  the  track  editor  by  pressing
           <SHIFT+F1>.

     So,  once  you've  picked  your car, opponent  and  track,  the aim is to
     firstly finish the course, secondly to beat your opponent, and thirdly to
     do  it  in  record time, but most of  all  to have a ball while doing so.
     Which  isn't  all  that  hard, since not  much  can  compare to leaping a
     building in a Formula 1 racing car (or any car for that matter)!

     Now  you're  hurtling down the track. You  took that last jump with ease,
     and a corkscrew looms menacingly ahead. No problem you think to yourself,
     you've completed this stunt successfully many times before. But this time
     you  are  over  confident and the  inevitable  happens.  You approach the
     maneuver  too  fast and lose control, and  the  wreckage of your car gets
     strewn all over the race track.

     There's  nothing extremely exciting about that, except the amazing things
     that  can  happen as you crash! Do not  be surprised if you find your car
     soaring  hundreds  of meters above the  ground! Sometimes before a crash,
     sometimes  after, but don't ever expect to survive such a fall! And there
     is  nothing like going vertical in a F1  racing car to add some thrill to
     you spill! It's all part of the fun.

     To  top it all off, Stunts also includes a 10 minute replay buffer (which
     is  long enough for almost any race!).  So when you complete that perfect
     drive, make an incredible recovery from a certain death situation, have a
     crash  that is truly spectacular, or do  anything that you want to take a
     second look at, it's preserved for you in the replay, which you can watch
     immediately,  or  save  to  disk for  viewing  later.  Plus, for ultimate
     viewing  scrutiny, Stunts provides a number  of viewing cameras (for both
     viewing replays and racing from!), including a user controlled viewpoint!
     And of course, you are free to give your replays to your friends, so that
     they  can see your incredible feats of  driving. In fact, you can use the
     tracks  you  design on any version of  Stunts, including the PC and Amiga
     versions.  Sadly,  the same compatibility is  not true for replays, which
     will  only work accurately on the same version of the game that they were
     saved on.

     Stunts does have a small number of bugs. The most notable is the infamous
     "overdrive"  bug.  This is essentially  an  "afterburner" for your racing
     car,  or  a  tank of nitrous oxide  that  never  runs out. "Overdrive" is
     really more of a feature than a bug, since it does make the game more fun
     to play (as you can imagine).

     WRAPPING UP

     To  me, Stunts is a fantastic game. I consider it so good that it has had
     permanent  residence on my harddrive for more than three years! This says
     quite a lot to me, since no version of DOS that I've used has lasted that
     long (or any machine I've had)! In fact, the only additional feature that
     Stunts  does not provide, which would be truly appreciated is the ability
     to play head to head with a friend through a serial link.

     I  barely  hesitate to suggest that there  would be no one that would not
     enjoy  playing  Stunts, however if you  enjoy a fast paced, action filled
     game, then Stunts is definitely for you. And when you find it, you should
     be  pleasantly  surprised that it won't cost you  an arm and a leg to buy
     it.

   [1.6] A COMPARISON OF DRIVING SPEEDS

     (by Alan Robinson for "The Stunts Shrine", 1996)

     ABSTRACT

     Which driving program is better, Stunts version 1.10 or 4D Sports Driving
     version  1.10? These are slightly different versions of the same program,
     and  therefor  driving  times  can be  compared  using  the same cars and
     tracks.  The driving speed of two cars on two different tracks using both
     Stunts  and 4D Sports Driving were  compared in this study. Results where
     not  completely conclusive, but the  two programs are roughly equivalent,
     for most uses.

     INTRODUCTION

     There  are four versions of the  program in question, Stunts version 1.00
     and  version 1.10, and 4D Sports Driving version 1.00 and version 1.10. A
     question  that has been raised, mostly in high score competition is, "Are
     there  any differences between the handling  of the two programs?". Since
     access  was  only available to Stunts  version 1.10 and 4D Sports Driving
     version 1.10, this study only concerns itself with those two programs. It
     is  hoped  that most people have upgraded  to the latest version of there
     respect program, one way or another.

     The  speed  issue is a complex question  that would require many tests to
     truely  determine for all cars and conditions.  The goal of this study is
     not to do so, but instead to determine if such studies are needed.

     MATERIAL & METHODS

     Two tracks were created for use in this study.

     Track  One is a large (one track editing screen full) banked circle, with
     no stunts. This track was driven with the Porsche March Indy car, at full
     speed for the entire track.

     Track  Two is a small track, with four large size, unbanked turns, making
     a  almost  perfect circle. This track  was  driven with the Corvette ZR1,
     attempting to drive the car as fast as possible, without spinning off the
     track.

     In  both  cases  the games were run on  a  60 MHz Zeos Pantera, using the
     keyboard  as driving input, and SBOS providing SoundBlaster emulation for
     the  Gravis UltraSound. No simulation engine  bugs were exploit to attain
     higher speeds.

     Track  One results are faster for 4D Sports Driving, but not by more than
     the  experimental  error.  Track  Two  results  show  Stunts  ahead  by a
     significant amount.

     DISCUSSION

     In  the first test there was  very little experimental error, because the
     car  was  made  to drive as fast  as  it  could, i.e. the accelerator was
     floored  the entire time. While the experimental error is very small, the
     difference  between  the two speeds is  just as small, suggesting that if
     there is any difference between the Porsche March Indy top speeds for the
     two programs, it is insignificant.

     The  second  track  implies fairly strongly  that  cars  (or at least the
     Corvette  ZR1) in Stunts version 1.10 have higher top turning speeds then
     they  do in 4D Sports Driving version 1.10. However, due to the fact that
     these  scores rely purely on the skills of the driver, and his luck, they
     have  high  experimental error. Even so  they  imply pretty strongly that
     Stunts' cars are faster.

     CONCLUSION

     There  does  appear  to be some  difference  between the two programs, at
     least  for  the  Corvette ZR1. More cars,  tracks,  and stunts need to be
     tested  before  any definite conclusions can  be drawn, but it looks like
     all  4D Sports Driving users should update to Stunts version 1.10. In any
     case,  competitions,  while  slightly less  valid  when competing between
     different  versions,  should  not be a  problem  unless  the driving time
     between first and second place is less than a few seconds.

*  [1.7] SIMILAR RACING GAMES

     If  you want more action similar to Stunts/4D Sports Driving you may want
     to  try  the following games: Big  Red Racing (Domark), Destruction Derby
     (Psygnosis), Fatal Racing (?), Midtown Madness (Microsoft), Monster Truck
     Madness  (Microsoft),  S.O.D.A.  Off-Road  Racing  (Sierra), Screamer Fun
     (Virgin), Stunt Track Racer (?) and Test Drive: Off-Road (Accolade).

     The  long  awaited successor of  Stunts/4D Sports Driving called "Thrust,
     Twist'n  Turn"  by  Carts Entertainment/Take 2  seems  not  be as good as
     expected.  At  least the PC versions were  rated  very low by the top two
     German gaming magazines.

     "PC Games" 7/99 rated it 45%. "PC Player" 7/99 rated it 44%.

     TTT  seems to be very different from its packaging text: There are only 8
     tracks instead of 18. It has four different but boring cars. And the most
     important: it does NOT contain a track editor.

     They  are  still  some rumors Electronic Arts  is  working on a sequel of
     Stunts/4D Sports Driving, but we can't confirm or deny this.

  All   modern  computer  system  match   these  requirements,  but  for  your
  satisfaction, here they are.

   [2.1] HARDWARE

     Stunts/4D   Sports   Driving  requires  an   Intel   8086  processor  (or
     compatibles)  running  with 8 MHz or faster.  You  will also need a video
     card,  such as Hercules, CGA, EGA or MCGA/VGA, 640K of memory and a 5.25"
     or 3.5" disk drive.

     AdLib, SoundBlaster or Roland MT-32 sound cards and Joystick or Mouse are
     supported.

   [2.2] SOFTWARE

     Stunts/4D Sports Driving requires Microsoft MS-DOS version 3.30 or later.

  Yes,  your  favourite racing game contains  some bugs and game errors, which
  are listed here, because DSI did not release any official bug-fixes and it's
  very hard to bug-fix an encrypted program ourself ;-).

   [3.1] STRANGE GRAPHICS

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91

     Since  Stunts/4D Sports Driving is a really old game, which was developed
     for XTs and ATs, the programmers had to highly optimize their code to run
     at  a  reasonable  speed. In these times  computers  did  not have a math
     co-processor which would be required for 3D graphics (because you have to
     calculate some matrices/vectors). DSI decided to use integer math instead
     of  floating-point  routines. But integer math  is sometimes a little bit
     inaccurate  and computer displays do not  have half or quarter pixels, so
     the  result  has to be rounded. All  these facts lead to strange graphics
     known to you.

     SOLUTION: Buy  a  high-end  IBM-PC/Sony  Playstation/Nintendo  64,  and a
               modern racing game.

   [3.2] BUILT-IN TRACK EDITOR BUG

     VERSIONS: DEC-13-90

     If  you use the cursor keys (left, right, up, down) in the Track Editor's
     tile  selection  bar,  your computer system  probably  hangs  after a few
     keypresses.

     SOLUTION: Do  not  use  the keyboard, use your  mouse  or  use one of the
               external terrain/track editors!

   [3.3] TOO MANY TRACKS BUG

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91

     The number of track files per directory is limited. If you have more than
     127  files in one directory, the  track selection window does not display
     any  tracks,  the  display screws up  or  your computer system hangs. The
     later  versions allow more files, but  these files are not displayed, and
     the  quick access keys ('A' for the  first track file that begins with an
     A) are disabled.

     SOLUTION: Split up your track files into sub-directories!

   [3.4] SWERVE ABOUT GAME ERROR

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91

     Sometimes  your  opponents will behave a  little bit strange. They swerve
     about,  especially on banked corners on hills. This seems to be caused by
     a game design error.

     SOLUTION: Give them a slower car! ;-)

   [3.5] OVERDRIVE BUG

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91

     At  a certain speed your car will  fire something like an afterburner and
     if you go off the track (to the grass) your car will not become slower.

     SOLUTION: This is not a real bug. It is feature. Just use it!

   [3.6] ROCKET BOUNCE

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91

     Imagine  that  you have several bridges or  ramps in a row and your jumps
     are  going wider and wider from bridge to bridge. Then if you hit such an
     obstacle  exactly  at the highest point  (where  the up and down elements
     connect)  your car will bounce off in a nearly 90ø angle and start like a
     rocket  to  the  moon. In most cases  your  car  crashes if you return to
     earth.

     SOLUTION: How about braking before a jump?

   [4.1] CURVES

     In  order  to drive a curve really  quickly,  you should try to avoid the
     skidding  sound. It will slow you down more, than if you had broken a bit
     more earlier.

   [4.2] CORKSCREWS (LEFT/RIGHT)

     The corkscrew (left/right) is a very difficult object for beginners to go
     through.  Simply pass it at the right,  between the red separator and the
     corkscrew's lane. This should save you some seconds.

   [4.3] PAVED SLALOM ROADS

     Paved  slalom roads are passed best, if you drive your car exactly on the
     dashed centre line.

   [5.1] FALSE START

     Choose your car, your opponent and your opponent's car.

     a) Click on the "Let's Drive" icon!
          Your car leaves the truck.
     b) Press <Escape> twice!
          The replay menu appears.
     c) Choose "Continue Driving"!

     Now  you  can start right from your  truck.  This will result in a longer
     run-up  way, which will give you a  lead over your opponent. Best results
     are achieved with slow cars like the Lamborghini LM-002.

     NOTE: This cheat will make the replays going crazy.

   [5.2] INTERNAL TERRAIN EDITOR

     Stunts/4D  Sports Driving comes with a built-in terrain editor, which can
     be reached via <SHIFT+F1> from the track editor screen.

+  [5.3] HARMLESS OBJECTS

     There are some objects which do not cause a damage to your car. These are
     traffic  signs,  traffic  lights and trees  at  the highway, the pylon at
     "Joe's", pumps and the pylon at the gas station.

     TER3  is the only terrain editor that  is a native Microsoft Windows 3.xx
     application.  It  provides the basic  drawing  functions like STUNTSED or
     TERREDIT.  On  some computers I was unable  to  start TER3, I only got an
     empty  message  box with an <OK>  button. No error message was displayed.
     But  if  you can make TER3 run,  there  are no problems in creating track
     terrains.

     OB  allows  you to modify the  opponent  resource files of Stunts version
     1.00  (OCT-05-90)  to  make it a little  bit  harder  for you to beat the
     computer opponents. You can edit each opponent's speed value for specific
     track tiles, e.g. paved roads, paved corners, bridges or chicanes.

     time  achieved,  the  opponent's name, your  and  your opponent's car and
     their  colors  and the gear shifting mode  (auto  or manual). Also it can
     extract  the  track used in the  replay. RPLINFO for Windows supports the
     same driving style analysis as RA.

     STEDIT is the best terrain editor available. It outdoes all other terrain
     editors  with  it's  automatic drawing mode  for  hills.  Otherwise it is
     similiar to TERREDIT, but it's faster.

     We  recommend  to use this editor in  combination with TE. STEDIT for the
     terrain (due to the automatic drawing mode) and TE for the real track.

     CONCLUSION: + automatic drawing mode

     a  little  bit  hard for the novices to  use.  But  it is great for track
     creating people, who do not have any idea for their sceneries.

     CONCLUSION: + powerful
                 + takes thinking from you ;-)
                 + source code available
                 - hard to use for novices

   [6.E] STUNTS TERRAIN EDITOR (TERREDIT)

     AUTHOR  : Ron Lewkiewicz <?>
     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91
     RATING  : [**___]

     TERREDIT  has only the basic drawing  functions for creating terrains. No
     special functions, no gimmicks, just straightforward.

     CONCLUSION: + 'whole-track-at-once' editing
                 + mouse support
                 - no automatic drawing mode

     RATING  : [***__]

     TB  is a terrain and track editor with lots of special functions directed
     towards the power user, these include an automatic scenery generating (as
     in  SSG), a clipboard function (for terrain only?) and the possibility to
     compare 2 tracks. It also allows 'whole-track-at-once' editing.

     CONCLUSION: + automatic scenery generator
                 + clipboard
                 + 'whole-track-at-once' editing
                 - confused design
                 - hard to use and hard to setup as most Nailwood products
                 - unable to create new tracks

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91
     RATING  : [****_]

     TE  is  a  very well designed editor  for  terrain  and track pieces from
     Poland.  It  is very similiar to the  built-in  track editor but has some
     additional   tiles   for  combinations  often   used   in  tracks  and  a
     'whole-track-at-once'  preview mode. Unfortunatly  it lacks mouse support
     and  an automatic drawing mode (available in STEDIT). We recommend to use
     this  nice editor in combination with STEDIT. STEDIT for the terrain (due
     to the automatic drawing mode) and TE for the real track.

     CONCLUSION: + well designed
                 + for terrain & track editing
                 - lacks mouse support
                 - no automatic drawing mode

     UPDATE.EXE  was  made for those racing  championships  which are held all
     around  the  globe. It writes an  updated highscore file by comparing two
     existing  highscore files and the relating  track files taking the better
     times to this new file.

     CONCLUSION: + very fast

     WINEDIT  is  a native Win32 application similar  to  CB. It allows you to
     change  several  parameters  of your car  to  maximize its performance. I
     tried  WINEDIT  on 3 different computers  running Windows 95 with various
     different  car resource files from  all Stunts/4D Sports Driving versions
     but  I never got a correct display of the values. Every time it displayed
     something like: "Number of gears: 62534".

     CONCLUSION: + native Win32 (Windows 9x/Windows NT) application

+  [7.5] MAKING A MOVIE

     As  replay  files  can  not be  exchanged  between  different versions of
     Stunts/4D  Sports  Driving we looked for  another  method to make replays
     available to all people.

     A  combination  of  DTA,  PICTVIEW and  PROGRAB  lets  you  create replay
     animations  which  can be displayed  without  Stunts/4D Sports Driving or
     even if you have the wrong version of Stunts/4D Sports Driving. Here is a
     step-by-step description to build a .FLI file from your finest replay:

     1) At first you have to load PROGRAB as a TSR.

        # prograb

     2) Now  you  can run Stunts/4D Sports  Driving.  Load your desired replay
        file  from  the  options  screen. Rewind  the  tape  to  the beginning
        (00:00.00).  Make  your  first screen  shot  by  pressing <CTRL+SCROLL
        LOCK>.  Forward the tape after each screenshot by 0.1 (or 0.2, 0.5, 1)
        seconds. Take your next screenshot. Proceed until you reach the end of
        your replay. Quit Stunts/4D Sports Driving by pressing <CTRL+X>.

     3) Imagine  that  you  took the first 10  seconds  of your replay with 10
        pictures  (frames)  per second. So you have  100 .TGA files plus 1 for
        00:00.00.  Each picture occupies exactly 64.786 bytes, i.e. this short
        sequence  of pictures takes ~6.390 Kbyte  on your hard disk. So please
        bare in mind that 1 minute would take ~37 Mbyte!!!

     4) You do not need PROGRAB any more.

        # prograb /u

     5) DTA  will build a .FLI animation  from your screenshots. This may take
        several seconds or even minutes.

        # dta *.tga /snnn

        Where  nnn  should be 7 if you made  10 screenshots a second (14 for 5
        shots, 35 for 2 shots, and 70 for one shot per second).

     6) PICTVIEW can be used to display this animation.

        # pictview anim.fli

     For  your  most spectacular crashes remember  that  you can change camera
     positions  and  zoom in/zoom out. If  you have a picture editing software
     like  NeoPaint  or DeluxePaint you can  add  several nice effects to your
     pictures before creating the .FLI file.

     You are now able to create your own stunt movies & crash scenes without a
     risk for your life!

  This  part  contains  information about the  specific  file  formats used in
  Stunts/4D  Sports Driving. These information  might help some programmers to
  write new editing/viewing programs.

   [8.1] CAR RESOURCE FILES

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91

     OFFSET   SIZE      DESCRIPTION

   [8.2] HIGHSCORE FILES

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91

     In  highscore files (*.HIG) are stored: driver's name, driver's car name,
     opponent's  initials,  opponent's car name and  the  time achieved by the
     human  driver. Highscore files are always 364 bytes large (7 entries   52
     bytes).

     OFFSET   SIZE      DESCRIPTION

     0x0000   17 Chars  Driver's name
                          (zero-terminated string)
     0x0011   25 Chars  Driver's car name

                          (zero-terminated string)
     0x0032   Word      Time achieved by human driver

     The time value has to be divided by 20 to get a result in seconds, e.g.

          2131 / 20 = 106.55 seconds = 1 minute, 46 seconds, 55 hundredth

   [8.3] OPPONENT RESOURCE FILES

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90

     Each  opponent  has an individual  file (OPP?.RES) which contains his/her
     speed  (must be between 5 and 200 mph) for the different track tiles, the
     driver's  initials  and  his/her  messages  after  a  race.  Only version
     OCT-05-90  has  these  files  unencrypted.  All  other  versions have the
     opponent information in the OPP?.PRE files which are encrypted.

   [8.4] REPLAY FILES

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91

     There  are  two  different  formats of  replay  files.  The old format is
     compatible with versions OCT-05-90 and DEC-13-90. The new format was used
     in FEB-12-91 and FEB-25-91.

     CONFIGURATION BLOCK

     The  configuration  block  starts at offset  0x0000  and is 24 Bytes (new
     format: 26 Bytes) long.

     0x0018   Word      Keyboard Event Block length in bytes
                          (To determine the replay time in seconds you have
                           to divide this value by the word at offset 0x0016.
                           See section [8.2].)

     TRACK BLOCK

     The track block starts at offset 0x0018 (new format: 0x001A) and is 1,802
     bytes long. See section [8.5].

     KEYBOARD EVENT BLOCK

     At  offset  0x0722 (new format: 0x0724)  the keyboard event block begins.
     Each  event  is  represented  by one byte  and  can  consist of up to six
     simultanously keypresses (in theory).

     The  following chart shows how keypresses  are encoded. If a specific bit
     is set the corresponding key was pressed, if the bit is clear the key has
     been released.

                           Bit 76543210   Keyboard event
                               ³³³³³³³³
                               ³³³³³³³ÀÄÄ Accelerate key pressed
                               ³³³³³³ÀÄÄÄ Brake key pressed
                               ³³³³³ÀÄÄÄÄ Right key pressed
                               ³³³³ÀÄÄÄÄÄ Left key pressed
                               ³³³ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄ Shift up key pressed
                               ³³ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Shift down key pressed
                               ÀÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Unused (should be 0)

     But  how large is the keyboard event  block? You will find out by reading
     the  word value at offset 0x0016 (new  format: 0x0018). It shows how many
     bytes you have to process.

     FORMAT DETECTION

     To  detect the old format you have to  read the word at offset 0x0016. If
     its  value + 0x0722 corresponds to the replay file size you have detected
     the old replay file format.

     For  the  new format you have to read  the  word at offset 0x0018. If its
     value  + 0x0724 corresponds to the replay file size you have detected the
     new replay file format.

     Weird, huh?!

     CONCLUSION

     As  you see from above you can write a replay file viewer and probably an
     editor.  But  writing a converter between the  old  and the new format is
     useless,  because  there  are some  things,  which we call "environmental
     conditions",  that  influence the behaviour of  a car too. These settings
     vary from version to version and can't be controlled by the user.

*  [8.5] TRACK FILES

     (major corrections by Markus Nagelholz)

     VERSIONS: OCT-05-90, DEC-13-90, FEB-12-91, FEB-25-91

     Each  track is on a 30x30 grid of squares:  30 x 30 = 900 bytes for track
     layout + 1 byte for horizon + 30 x 30 = 900 bytes for terrain information
     + 1 pad byte (zero), i.e. any track file should be 1,802 bytes long.

     Track  layout starts at offset 0x0000, which is the bottom left corner of
     the  track  [30/01]. The next element is  [30/02], and so on. The mapping
     system  is therefore row by row, bottom to top. Offset 0x0383 defines the
     top right track element [01/30].

     Horizon  is  at offset 0x0384.

     Terrain  elements start at offset 0x0385. The coding system is row by row
     too  (from left to right), but from  top to bottom (contrary to the track
     elements).

     TRACK VALUES

     Empty track elements have the value 0.

     NOTE: A value of 2 displays the currently selected car in the default
           color. A value of 3 represents the opponent's car.

     Multi-field  elements (e.g. banked corners, chicanes, ...) have a special
     coding system:

         ID 255
        254 253

     2-field  elements  (corkscrews  left/right and  loops)  only  have the ID
     element and 255 (horizontally oriented) or 254 (vertically oriented). The
     element  is  defined  by  the top left  byte  (ID).  The whole element is
     displayed  and  also the track is valid,  even  if the bytes of the other
     sub-elements are set to 0.

     If  a  sub-element  is not set with  the  values described above, it will
     still  be displayed as defined by the ID element, but it will behave like
     the track element corresponding to the specific value.

     If  a  track has been created with  some of the special effects described
     above,  it should only be opened  with special editors like TRACK BLASTER
     PRO  and  not  with  the integrated  editor  of  the game. Otherwise such
     elements will be deleted.
